# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m AlexEshil

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on **Finro** â€” an ML-powered trading system using Python and .NET
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Python, machine learning, trading strategies, and ASP.NET MVC
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: technical analysis (RSI, EMA, MACD), RandomForest, Telegram bots, Python â†” C# integration
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Just call me ðŸ˜Ž
- ðŸ¤“ Fun fact: When my algorithm hits a perfect signal I yell: *"Take money ðŸš€*

The `Finro` project is currently private, but Iâ€™ll be releasing parts of it soon â€” stay tuned!
